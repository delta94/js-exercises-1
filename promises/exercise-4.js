  /* 1. Create a promise. Have it fulfilled with the list of wines after a delay of 3000ms, using setTimeout.
     2. Then, print the contents of the promise after it has been fulfilled by passing console.log to then.
     3. Create a failedPromise that rejects with the error message 'something is broken' after a delay of 3000ms, using setTimeout
     4. Then, using the contents of the promise after it returns, console.log the error message 'Oh no, the request failed becasuse' and append the error message;
  
     Extra challenge:
     A. Update the onSuccess function so that takes the returned wines, filters the list to only include the red wines and then print that list 
     B. Refactor your code so that instead of seperate named callback functions 'onSuccess' and 'onReject', you write the functions inline */
